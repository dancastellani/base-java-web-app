base-java-web-app
=================

A base Java Web App with Spring + Flyway + JUnit + Mockito and some more stuff.

Why create a base project?
-
Every time I have to start a new Java project I loose some time configuring it. And as my memory is not elefant like, I forget some steps and run into some beautiful and large Java stack traces.
So, I created this project, configured and ready to start with almost every Java must have framework that I use in Web Dev.

Hope you like it! =D

Pre-requisites:
-

This project only needs Java 6 and Maven 3.

Instructions:
-

As the project is already configured with Jetty Embbed you can run it with the following comand:
<pre>
mvn clean jetty:run-war
</pre>

What it has?
-

The detailed configurations are in the index.html that can be checked after aplication deploy (as explained above on the inscruction).
